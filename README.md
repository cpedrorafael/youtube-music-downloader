# Simple CLI App to Download Music from YouTube in MP3 Format

This application uses `yt-dlp` to download music from YouTube in MP3 format.

## Usage

1. Create a `list.txt` file and paste in it the songs you want to download.
    - Example of `list.txt` content:
      ```
      Song x - Artist 1
      Song y - Artist 2
      Song z - Artist 3
      Song w - Artist 4
      ```

2. Run the application and insert the path to the directory where the `list.txt` file is.

Enjoy your music! :)

## Note

- Currently using `yt-dlp` macOS with Apple Silicon. 
- If you want to run it on other platforms, you can download the corresponding `yt-dlp` executable from [yt-dlp releases](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases).
